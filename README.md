# E-Commerce Sales Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an e-commerce sales dataset to understand
sales trends, product performance, and customer purchasing patterns.

## Objectives
- Analyze overall sales performance

- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains order-level information including sales, categories, regions, and dates.
Basic cleaning and preprocessing were performed before analysis.

## Key Analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing and duplicate values
- Sales trend analysis over time
- Category-wise and region-wise performance
- Visual representation of key metrics
## Project Structure
- Sample - Superstore.csv → Dataset
